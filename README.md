### ⚔️ ZeroBitch — Agent Swarm Orchestration

ZeroBitch is ClawTrol's fleet management layer for [ZeroClaw](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw) — a lightweight, Rust-based AI agent runtime. Instead of running a single agent, ZeroBitch lets you spawn, manage, and orchestrate a **swarm of ZeroClaw instances** as Docker containers, each with its own role, model, personality, and resource limits. Think of it as Kubernetes for your AI agents — launch a security auditor, a research analyst, and a code reviewer, all running in parallel on cheap/free LLMs, coordinated from one dashboard.

- **Fleet Dashboard** (`/zerobitch`) — Monitor all agent instances with real-time status, RAM, CPU, sparkline charts
- **One-Click Spawn** — Create agents from 6 templates (Infra Monitor, Research Analyst, Security Auditor, Content Writer, Code Reviewer, Data Analyst) or configure custom agents
- **Docker Lifecycle** — Start/Stop/Restart/Destroy containers directly from the UI
- **Task Dispatch** — Send prompts to individual agents and track execution results with timing
- **Memory Browser** — Browse each agent's SQLite memory database, transfer knowledge between agents
- **Auto-Scaler Rules** — Define conditions for automatic fleet scaling (e.g., "if CPU > 80% on all agents, spawn another")
- **SOUL.md / AGENTS.md Editor** — Edit agent personality and instructions from the detail page, changes mount into the container live
- **Logs Viewer** — Real-time container log streaming with auto-scroll and filtering
- **Batch Operations** — Start/stop/restart multiple agents at once
- **Resource Limits** — Per-agent memory (default 32MB) and CPU caps to keep your fleet lightweight

### 🔄 Model Rate Limiting
- **Model Status** — Check which models are available
- **Best Model Selection** — Automatically pick the best available model
- **Rate Limit Recording** — Track when models hit limits
- **Auto-Fallback** — Seamlessly switch to backup models when limited

### 🔗 Follow-up Tasks
- **Parent Linking** — Chain related tasks together with visual parent links
- **AI Suggestions** — Generate follow-up task suggestions with AI
- **Create Follow-ups** — One-click follow-up creation with model/session inheritance
- **Auto-Done** — Parent auto-completes when follow-up is created

### 🔒 Task Dependencies
- **Blocking System** — Tasks can block other tasks with `blocked_by`
- **Circular Detection** — Prevents infinite dependency loops
- **🔒 Badge** — Blocked tasks show badge with blocker info
- **Drag Prevention** — Can't move blocked tasks to `in_progress`

### 🔔 Notifications
- **Bell Icon** — Notification center in navbar with unread count badge
- **Event Types** — Agent claimed, task completed, validation results
- **Browser Notifications** — Optional browser notification API integration
- **Mark All Read** — One-click clear all notifications
- **Telegram Push** — Get instant Telegram messages when tasks move to `in_review` or `done`
- **Webhook Push** — Generic webhook (JSON POST) for custom integrations (Slack, Discord, etc.)
- **Settings UI** — Configure Telegram bot token, chat ID, and webhook URL in Settings → Notifications tab
- **Test Button** — Send a test notification to verify your setup
- **Zero Dependencies** — Pure Rails, no external services required

#### Setting Up Telegram Notifications

1. Create a Telegram bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and copy the token
2. Send `/start` to your bot, then get your chat ID from [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)
3. Go to **Settings → Notifications** in ClawTrol
4. Paste your bot token and chat ID
5. Click **Test Notification** to verify
6. Done — you'll get a Telegram message every time a task completes

#### Webhook Integration

Set a webhook URL in Settings → Notifications. ClawTrol will POST JSON on task completion:

```json
{
  "event": "task_status_change",
  "task_id": 123,
  "task_name": "Fix login bug",
  "status": "in_review",
  "message": "📋 Task #123 → In review\n\nFix login bug\n\n...",

## How It Works

1. You create tasks and organize them on boards.
2. You move work to `up_next` and assign it to the agent queue.
3. ClawTrol auto-runner claims runnable tasks (respecting nightly gating for nightly work).
4. OpenClaw is the orchestrator: it picks claimed work, routes model/persona, and executes.
5. OpenClaw must always report structured outcome via `POST /api/v1/hooks/task_outcome`.
6. OpenClaw must always persist execution output via `POST /api/v1/hooks/agent_complete`.
7. Task moves to `in_review`; follow-up is `YES/NO` plus recommendation, never silent.
8. If follow-up is needed, requeue happens only after explicit human approval, using the same card (`POST /api/v1/tasks/:id/requeue`).
9. If no follow-up is needed, task remains in `in_review` and the human decides next action.

## OpenClaw Onboarding and Self-Heal

- Main guide: `docs/OPENCLAW_ONBOARDING.md`
- Fast path in UI: `Settings -> Integration -> Agent Install Prompt`
- Contract summary:
  - OpenClaw executes work; ClawTrol stores state and reporting.
  - Every completed run sends both hooks: `task_outcome` then `agent_complete`.
  - Follow-up recommendation is mandatory (`needs_follow_up: true|false`).
  - Same-task follow-up is preferred to avoid kanban bloat.
  - Nightly window for Argentina: `23:00-08:00` (`America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires`, UTC-3).

## Agent Install Prompt (OpenClaw / Telegram Orchestrator)

ClawTrol works best when your orchestrator has an explicit "tooling + reporting contract" prompt so it:

- knows which endpoints exist and how to authenticate
- always reports back deterministically at the end of each run
- can requeue the same task for follow-ups (no kanban bloat)

In your running instance, open `http://<host>:<port>/settings` → `Integration` and use **Agent Install Prompt**.

If you're integrating manually:

- API endpoints live under `/api/v1/*` (Bearer token)
- Completion hooks live under `/api/v1/hooks/*` (`X-Hook-Token`)
- Follow-up is signaled via `POST /api/v1/hooks/task_outcome` with `recommended_action="requeue_same_task"`

### One-Prompt Install

**Copy this entire prompt to your AI assistant:**

> Install and configure ClawTrol (AI agent mission control) for me. Do ALL steps — don't stop until you've verified everything works.
>
> **Step 1 — Clone & Install**
> ```bash
> cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/wolverin0/clawtrol.git clawdeck
> cd clawdeck
> chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
> ```
> If Docker isn't available, fall back to manual:
> ```bash
> bundle install && bin/rails db:prepare && bin/dev
> ```
>
> **Step 2 — Wait for server**
> - Docker: port 4001
> - Manual: port 3000
> - Health check: `curl -sf http://localhost:PORT/up` (retry up to 30s)
>
> **Step 3 — Create user account**
> ```bash
> cd ~/clawdeck && bin/rails runner "
>   User.create!(
>     email: 'MY_EMAIL',
>     password: 'MY_PASSWORD',
>     name: 'MY_NAME'
>   )
>   puts '✅ User created'
> "
> ```
>
> **Step 4 — Generate API token + Hooks token**
> ```bash
> cd ~/clawdeck && bin/rails runner "
>   user = User.find_by!(email: 'MY_EMAIL')
>   api_token = user.api_tokens.create!(name: 'Agent')
>   puts 'API_TOKEN=' + api_token.token
>   puts 'HOOKS_TOKEN=' + Rails.application.config.hooks_token.to_s
> "
> ```
> Save both tokens — the API token is only shown once.
>
> **Step 5 — Create a default board**
> ```bash
> curl -s -X POST http://localhost:PORT/api/v1/boards \
>   -H "Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN" \
>   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
>   -d '{"name": "Main", "icon": "🚀"}' | jq .
> ```
>
> **Step 6 — Configure yourself as the ClawTrol agent**
>
> Add these to your workspace TOOLS.md (or equivalent config):
> ```
> ### ClawTrol (Task Dashboard / Mission Control)
> | Key | Value |
> |-----|-------|
> | URL | http://HOST:PORT |
> | API Token | API_TOKEN |
> | Hooks Token | HOOKS_TOKEN |
> | Agent Name | YOUR_AGENT_NAME |
> | Agent Emoji | YOUR_EMOJI |
> ```
>
> Add these env vars (e.g., `~/.openclaw/.env` or your agent's env):
> ```bash
> CLAWTROL_API_TOKEN=API_TOKEN
> CLAWTROL_HOOKS_TOKEN=HOOKS_TOKEN
APP_BASE_URL=http://HOST:PORT  # Used for webhook callbacks and links
> ```
>
> **Step 7 — Set up heartbeat polling**
>
> Add to your HEARTBEAT.md (or equivalent periodic check):
> ```markdown
> ### ClawTrol Tasks
> # Health check first
> curl -sf http://HOST:PORT/up >/dev/null 2>&1 || echo "⚠️ ClawTrol DOWN"
>
> # Poll for assigned tasks
> source ~/.openclaw/.env  # or wherever your env is
> curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLAWTROL_API_TOKEN" \
>   http://HOST:PORT/api/v1/tasks?assigned=true&status=up_next
> ```
>
> **Step 8 — Set up the completion contract**
>
> After EVERY task you complete, fire these two hooks IN ORDER:
>
> Hook 1 — `task_outcome` (structured result):
> ```bash
> curl -s -X POST http://HOST:PORT/api/v1/hooks/task_outcome \
>   -H "X-Hook-Token: $CLAWTROL_HOOKS_TOKEN" \
>   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
>   -d '{

>     "achieved": ["item 1", "item 2"],
>     "evidence": ["proof 1"],
>     "remaining": []
>   }'
> ```
>
> Hook 2 — `agent_complete` (saves output + transitions status):
> ```bash
> curl -s -X POST http://HOST:PORT/api/v1/hooks/agent_complete \
>   -H "X-Hook-Token: $CLAWTROL_HOOKS_TOKEN" \
>   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

>     "findings": "Detailed summary of work done",
>     "output_files": ["file1.rb", "file2.js"]
>   }'
> ```
>
> **Step 9 — Verify the full loop**
>
> Create a test task, execute it, fire both hooks, confirm it reaches `done` (or `in_review`):
> ```bash
> # Create
> TASK=$(curl -s -X POST http://HOST:PORT/api/v1/tasks \
>   -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLAWTROL_API_TOKEN" \
>   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
>   -d '{"name":"Test: onboarding verification","board_id":BOARD_ID,"status":"up_next","tags":["test","quick-fix"],"assigned_to_agent":true}')
> TASK_ID=$(echo $TASK | jq -r .id)
>
> # Move to in_progress
> curl -s -X PATCH http://HOST:PORT/api/v1/tasks/$TASK_ID \
>   -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLAWTROL_API_TOKEN" \
>   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
>   -d '{"status":"in_progress"}'
>
> # Fire hooks (use a random UUID as run_id)
> # ... (fire task_outcome + agent_complete as above)
>
> # Verify final status
> curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLAWTROL_API_TOKEN" \
>   http://HOST:PORT/api/v1/tasks/$TASK_ID | jq .status
> # Should be "done" (auto-review: quick-fix + output) or "in_review"
> ```
>
> **Step 10 — Report to me**
>
> Tell me:
> - ✅ Dashboard URL
> - ✅ Board created
> - ✅ API + Hooks tokens saved

### Webhook: Agent Complete (Auto-Save Pipeline)

`POST /api/v1/hooks/agent_complete`

Primary endpoint for autonomous agents to self-report completion and persist output. This is the recommended integration path for production agents.

**Authentication**

Send webhook token in header:

```
X-Hook-Token: YOUR_HOOKS_TOKEN
```

**Request Body (JSON)**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `task_id` | integer | ✅ | Target task ID to update |
| `findings` | string | ✅ | Work summary; stored under `## Agent Output` |
| `session_id` | string | optional | Agent session UUID for transcript/activity linking |
| `session_key` | string | optional | Session key used by terminal/transcript viewer |
| `output_files` | array[string] | optional | Explicit output file list (merged with auto-extracted files) |

**Example Request**

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://YOUR_HOST:4001/api/v1/hooks/agent_complete \
  -H "X-Hook-Token: YOUR_HOOKS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "task_id": 302,
    "findings": "Implemented feature X and updated docs.",
    "session_id": "sess_123",
    "session_key": "agent:main:subagent:abc",
    "output_files": ["README.md", "app/controllers/tasks_controller.rb"]
  }'
```

**Behavior**

- Auto-appends/updates `## Agent Output` in task description
- Auto-transitions task status to `in_review`
- Links session metadata when provided
- Auto-extracts output files from findings text and transcript commit data
- Merges + deduplicates discovered files and provided `output_files`

**Success Response**

- `200 OK` with updated task payload

**Error Responses**

- `401 Unauthorized` — missing/invalid `X-Hook-Token`
- `404 Not Found` — task not found
- `422 Unprocessable Entity` — invalid payload (e.g., missing required fields)

## Telegram Notification Routing

Tasks can route completion notifications back to the originating Telegram topic:

- **`origin_chat_id`** (string) — the Telegram chat/group ID the task was created from
- **`origin_thread_id`** (integer) — the topic/thread ID within that group

### Setup

1. Set `CLAWTROL_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` env var with your Telegram bot token
2. When creating tasks via the API, pass `origin_chat_id` and optionally `origin_thread_id`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4001/api/v1/tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"task": {"name": "Fix bug", "origin_chat_id": "-100123456789", "origin_thread_id": 42}}'
```

3. When the task reaches `in_review` or `done`, a notification is sent to that chat/topic automatically
4. If no `origin_chat_id` is set, Telegram notification is silently skipped
5. Webhook notifications (via `webhook_notification_url` on User) still work as a secondary mechanism
