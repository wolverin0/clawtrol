# 🦞 ClawDeck

**Open source mission control for your AI agents.**

ClawDeck is a kanban-style dashboard for managing AI agents powered by [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw). Track tasks, assign work to your agent, and collaborate asynchronously.

> 🚧 **Early Development** — ClawDeck is under active development. Expect breaking changes.
