# Futura Sistemas — Market Intelligence Report (Argentina)

**Author (role):** Senior Product Manager & Market Intelligence Analyst  
**Date:** 2026-02-09 (GMT-3)  
**Products covered:** FuturaDelivery, FuturaFitness, FuturaCRM + Services (AI integration, chatbots, AI video surveillance, automation)  
**Research requirement:** data-driven with real numbers from web research (citations summarized in Appendix)  

---

## Executive summary

Futura Sistemas is positioned to build a defensible SMB software portfolio in Argentina across three verticals: restaurant delivery enablement, consumer + B2B fitness, and SME operations (invoicing, inventory, POS, ecommerce, CRM, MercadoLibre). The opportunity is real in all three, but **not equally reachable** with the same effort/time.

### The single most important recommendation

**Push FuturaDelivery first.**

Because:

1) **Strong, quantifiable pain:** major delivery marketplaces are widely referenced charging restaurants roughly **25–35% commissions** depending on contract/logistics, creating a clear ROI argument for a “0% commission” direct channel.

2) **Market is large enough:** delivery in Argentina is reported around **USD 1.86B revenue in 2024** with around **160,000 delivery workers in 2025** in press coverage.

3) **Short sales cycle:** restaurant owners decide quickly; CRM decisions often involve accountants, migration anxiety, and longer evaluation.

4) **Beachhead & cross-sell:** restaurants are natural buyers of FuturaCRM modules (inventory/POS/AFIP) and Futura services (chatbots for WhatsApp orders; AI surveillance for security; automation).

### Secondary priorities

- **Second:** FuturaCRM — TAM is large (Argentina has **~517k PyMEs**) and compliance (AFIP/ARCA e-invoicing) forces adoption, but the market is crowded with strong incumbents (Xubio, Colppy, Contabilium, Tango, Calipso, Odoo). Win requires vertical focus + distribution (accountants/partners).

- **Third:** FuturaFitness — Argentina has **8,662 gyms** and **3.6M active gym users** (penetration **7.8%**), but B2C fitness monetization is hard due to free apps and retention dynamics. Best approach is hybrid: build B2C audience while securing B2B distribution through gyms/trainers.

### Core market numbers (Argentina)

- **Delivery market size:** ~**USD 1.86B (2024)** (press coverage).  
- **Delivery workforce:** ~**160,000 workers (2025)** (press coverage).  
- **Delivery app usage share:** PedidosYa ~**68%**, Rappi ~**15.3%** (directional stats).  
- **Food/drink establishments in CABA:** ~**25,800** licensed premises in a broad category (press coverage, Oct 2024).  
- **Gyms:** **8,662** (Mercado Fitness/Trainingym Radiografía 2024).  
- **Active gym users:** **3.6M** (Mercado Fitness).  
- **Trainer economics:** **67%** charge **< ARS 8,000/hour**; only **24%** depend exclusively on personal training income (Mercado Fitness PT report 2024).  
- **PyMEs:** ~**517k** in 2024 (official/academic indicators).  
- **E-commerce 2025:** **ARS 35.3T** billed, **+60% nominal / +22% real**, **645M units (+28%)**, average ticket **ARS 143,128 (+18%)** (CACE via press).  
- **Inflation:** **117.8% (2024)** → **31.5% (2025)**; forecasts for 2026 range roughly **~10–24%** depending on source; REM around ~20%.  
- **USD/ARS (Feb 2026):** official around **ARS 1,400–1,450**; blue around **ARS 1,435**; REM projected wholesale around **ARS 1,475**.

### 90-day execution plan (high-confidence)

- **Days 1–30:** FuturaDelivery — secure 10 paying restaurants using door-to-door + supplier intros + ROI calculator + “parallel channel” framing.
- **Days 31–60:** FuturaDelivery — case studies + referral engine + add retention tooling (WhatsApp campaigns, coupons) to increase restaurant LTV.
- **Days 61–90:** Cross-sell — launch “Restaurant Ops Pack” (inventory lite, POS integration, invoice-ready exports) as the bridge to FuturaCRM; sell first 3 service projects (WhatsApp bot, automation, basic surveillance bundle) to early restaurants.

# 1) Macroeconomic & digital context

## 1.1 Why macro matters for SMB SaaS in Argentina

Argentina’s historical inflation and FX volatility changes how SMBs buy software:

- They resist long contracts because costs become unpredictable.
- They prefer “pay-as-you-go” or tools that immediately create cashflow.
- They often negotiate “freeze pricing for 3–6 months.”

The 2024–2025 disinflation (reported annual inflation dropping from **117.8% (2024)** to **31.5% (2025)**) creates a more favorable environment for monthly subscription products because SMB owners can better forecast.

**Implication for Futura:**
- You can introduce annual plans again (with discounts) and actually expect adoption.
- You should build a pricing policy tied to quarterly updates; communicate transparently.

## 1.2 FX reference

For converting ARS to USD in this report we use **ARS 1,450 ≈ USD 1** as a working value (based on official around 1,400–1,450 and blue ~1,435 in early Feb 2026 coverage).

## 1.3 Digital commerce as the “platform shift”

CACE’s 2025 data (as reported by press) signals that e-commerce is now structurally integrated into Argentine consumption:

- **ARS 35.3T billed**
- **645M units sold**
- **Ticket ARS 143,128**

This impacts all Futura products:

- Restaurants: online ordering expectations rise.
- Fitness: consumers are used to subscription apps.
- PyMEs: marketplace-first sellers need inventory sync and invoicing automation.

---

# 2) Market sizing methodology (TAM/SAM/SOM)

Public data in Argentina is uneven. Therefore, this report uses:

1) **Hard counts** when available (gyms, gym users, PyMEs, e-commerce totals).  
2) **Proxy extrapolation** when needed (restaurant counts nationwide).  
3) **Three-scenario ranges** (Conservative/Base/Aggressive).  
4) **Bottom-up ARPU** anchored to competitor pricing.

We explicitly separate:

- **TAM**: maximum potential.
- **SAM**: reachable target segments (geography, digital readiness, product fit).
- **SOM**: realistic share in 12–24 months.

We also include a “**value-based TAM**” perspective: how much value Futura creates (savings, revenue increase) and what portion can be captured.

---

# 3) Market size (Argentina)

## 3.1 Restaurant / food businesses and delivery

### 3.1.1 Delivery market value

Press coverage cites:

- Delivery in Argentina moves about **USD 1.86B annually (2024)** and employs **~160k workers (2025)**.

Even if these figures include multiple verticals (food + grocery), they indicate the habit is entrenched.

### 3.1.2 Restaurant count proxy

National counts aren’t consistently published, but a strong proxy exists:

- CABA reportedly had around **25,800 licensed food/drink establishments** (broad rubric) as of late 2024.

To estimate national counts, we build scenarios:

| Scenario | Estimated food service establishments nationwide |
|---|---:|
| Conservative | 60,000 |
| Base | 90,000 |
| Aggressive | 120,000 |

These include restaurants, cafes, bars, parrillas, etc. Not all are delivery-viable.

### 3.1.3 Delivery adoption rate

We estimate delivery relevance as:

- Conservative: 30%
- Base: 35%
- Aggressive: 40%

Thus delivery-relevant establishments:

- Conservative: 18,000
- Base: 31,500
- Aggressive: 48,000

### 3.1.4 Platform dominance

Directional stats indicate:

- PedidosYa ~**68%** usage share
- Rappi ~**15.3%** usage share

This implies a duopoly or near-duopoly.

### 3.1.5 Commission/take rate pain

Multiple sources reference commission ranges in the **~25–35%** band depending on contract.

**Why it matters:**

- Restaurants typically operate at thin net margins.
- Commission turns profitable products into break-even.

### 3.1.6 Value-based sizing

Instead of asking only “how many restaurants,” ask “how much margin is being extracted.”

Example:

- If 30,000 restaurants have average delivery GMV ARS 2M/month (some lower, some much higher):

Total GMV/month = ARS 60B.

At 30% take rate = ARS 18B/month extracted.

Even if only 10% of orders migrate to direct channel: ARS 1.8B/month of commission savings created.

Futura captures a small fixed subscription of that value.

### 3.1.7 TAM/SAM/SOM for FuturaDelivery

We need a plausible ARPU.

If FuturaDelivery Pro is ARS 25,000/mo ≈ USD 17/mo ≈ USD 204/year.

| Scenario | Delivery-relevant | TAM (USD/year) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Conservative | 18,000 | 3.7M |
| Base | 31,500 | 6.4M |
| Aggressive | 48,000 | 9.8M |

SAM: reachable top metros, assume 50%.

SOM: 1–2% of SAM in 24 months.

**Base SOM:**

- SAM customers = 31,500 × 50% = 15,750
- SOM customers (1–2%) = 158–315

At USD 204/year → USD 32k–64k ARR.

**Key insight:** FuturaDelivery by itself is not a “huge USD TAM” if priced low, but it is an excellent acquisition wedge with cross-sell potential.

### 3.1.8 QR menu market

QR menu products are commoditized; examples include free tools and low-cost paid options such as SoyMenu (~ARS 15k/month). This means FuturaDelivery must be positioned as **direct ordering + retention**, not menu QR alone.

---

## 3.2 Fitness market (gyms, trainers, apps)

### 3.2.1 Gyms and users

Mercado Fitness / Trainingym “Radiografía 2024” reports:

- **8,662 gyms**
- **3.6M active gym users**
- penetration **7.8%** (8.9% including other activities)

This provides a strong foundation for TAM.

### 3.2.2 Trainer economics

The trainer report indicates:

- **67%** charge < ARS 8,000/hour.
- In AMBA, some charge higher (36% > ARS 11k; 22% > ARS 15k).
- Only **24%** rely exclusively on PT income.

**Implication:** trainer SaaS must be priced modestly or must clearly drive revenue.

### 3.2.3 Competitive pricing context

B2C:

- Hevy Pro is extremely affordable (~USD 3/mo).

B2B:

- Trainerize entry ~USD 9–10; mid ~USD 20–22.
- TrueCoach entry ~USD 26.
- Everfit entry ~USD 19.

### 3.2.4 FuturaFitness pricing sanity check

At ARS 1,450/USD:

- Basic ARS 15k ≈ USD 10.3/mo
- Pro ARS 29k ≈ USD 20/mo
- Elite ARS 49k ≈ USD 33.8/mo

This is:

- Higher than cheap B2C apps.
- Similar to entry-level B2B pricing.

Therefore FuturaFitness must choose a narrative:

- **B2C premium coaching** (needs visible outcomes)
- or **B2B trainer/gym tool** (needs client management)

### 3.2.5 TAM/SAM/SOM

We model paid conversion.

Assume:

- Serious fitness app usage: 15–25%
- Paid conversion: 2–5%
- ARPU: USD 120/year (Basic)

| Scenario | Paying users | TAM USD/year |
|---|---:|---:|
| Conservative | 10.8k | 1.3M |
| Base | 21.6k | 2.6M |
| Aggressive | 45k | 5.4M |

B2B gyms: 5% adoption at USD 500/year = ~USD 216k.

Conclusion: TAM exists, but success depends on retention and distribution.

---

## 3.3 PyMEs and management software

### 3.3.1 PyME count

Indicators cite about **517k PyMEs** in 2024.

### 3.3.2 AFIP/ARCA e-invoicing mandate

Electronic invoicing is mandatory; that creates a baseline demand floor.

### 3.3.3 Management software adoption

Public sources do not provide a single definitive adoption % for “management software.” In practice, many SMEs use a mix of:

- free AFIP tools
- basic invoicing software
- Excel
- POS vendor tools
- marketplace tools

We use conservative assumptions:

- 30% have any software
- 15% have cloud ERP/CRM
- 55% manual/Excel

### 3.3.4 Competitive pricing anchors

- Alegra: ARS 5,999 / 11,999 / 19,999
- Xubio: ARS 41,450+IVA → ARS 253,900+IVA
- Colppy: ARS 99,500/mo entry
- Contabilium: ARS 46k/mo entry
- Tango Nube: ARS 653k/mo

### 3.3.5 TAM/SAM/SOM

Segment by complexity:

- Micro: 250k
- Small: 200k
- Mid: 60k

FuturaCRM initial SAM likely small + mid.

Assume:

- 5% shop annually: 13k
- 1% win rate: 130
- ARPU USD 400/year

ARR addition ~USD 52k/year.

To scale, Futura must invest in distribution and migration tools.

# 4) Competitive landscape (deep dive)

## 4.1 FuturaDelivery competitors (3–5)

### 4.1.1 PedidosYa

**Type:** marketplace + logistics.  
**Dominance:** directional stats show highest usage share (~68%).  
**Restaurant economics:** commission ranges commonly referenced around 25–35% depending on contract/logistics.

**Strengths**
- Massive consumer demand
- Logistics fleet
- Brand trust

**Weaknesses**
- Commission compresses margins
- Restaurants don’t own customer relationship

**User complaints / restaurant complaints:** public sources more often discuss commission pressure and dependence on platform; specific complaint datasets are not always public.

**SWOT**
- Strength: scale
- Weakness: margin extraction
- Opportunity: expansion to grocery/fintech
- Threat: Uber Eats return; own-channel movement

### 4.1.2 Rappi

**Type:** super-app marketplace.  
**Restaurant economics:** sources cite 20–35% or 25–35% depending.

**Strengths**
- Multi-vertical
- Higher-income positioning

**Weaknesses**
- Smaller share in Argentina

**Partner complaints (from available sources):** concerns about deductions/liquidations clarity and high fees.

### 4.1.3 Uber Eats (returning)

**Type:** marketplace.  
**Strategic impact:** expected to bring aggressive growth tactics.

### 4.1.4 Own-channel ordering platforms

Examples: Waitry, RestoSimple, Pedidosfree.

**These are direct competitors** because they sell “no commission” ordering.

Futura’s edge must be:

- local support
- integration with local payments
- bundling with CRM and services

### 4.1.5 QR menu solutions

Many free options exist (Recafy, QueRestó, MiQR, Menulibre). Paid options exist (SoyMenu). This makes QR menu a feature, not a product.
